## 🌟 Introduction

Memory is a cornerstone of cognitive capability in AI systems, empowering them with dynamic adaptation, complex reasoning, and experiential learning. With the rise of LLM-driven agents, memory architectures have evolved from simple context windows to sophisticated systems that integrate parametric and non-parametric storage, fuse multimodal information, and facilitate knowledge sharing within multi-agent ecosystems.

This survey bridges the gap between **cognitive psychology** and **computational mechanisms**, providing a comprehensive overview and a unified theoretical framework for both Single-Agent and Multi-Agent memory systems.

### 🛠 The 4W Memory Taxonomy
We propose a structured taxonomy to analyze AI memory across four dimensions:
* **When (Lifecycle):** How long does memory persist? (Instantaneous, Session-based, or Persistent).
* **What (Information Type):** What is being stored? (Declarative facts, Procedural skills, Meta-cognitive reflections).
* **How (Storage Implementation):** How is it represented? (Implicit parametric weights vs. Explicit non-parametric external stores).
* **Which (Modality):** What formats are supported? (Unimodal text to heterogeneous Multimodal fusion of vision, audio, and sensors).

## 🏗 Survey Framework

Our research translates cognitive models (e.g., Atkinson-Shiffrin, Working Memory, CLS) into modern AI design patterns:

1.  **Theoretical Foundations:** Mapping psychological memory stages to AI components like KV-Cache, RAG, and Weights.
2.  **Single-Agent Memory:** Exploring hierarchical architectures, OS-like memory management (e.g., MemGPT), and self-evolving mechanisms.
3.  **Multi-Agent Memory:** Analyzing communication-based memory sharing, collective learning, and coordinated reasoning.
4.  **Evaluation Ecosystem:** A multidimensional framework assessing Retrieval, Dynamic Updating, Higher-order Cognition, and System Efficiency.
